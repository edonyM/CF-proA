esiest way to solve the problem, just a and c are all even numbers
#1 cin l r
#2 is l a even number?
#3 if YES, go to #4; if NO, l++
#4 is l+2<=l+r ?
#5 if YES,cout l l+1 l+2; if NO, cout -1

BUT:
    we can no get all the consistent arrays.

When I try my method, it runs out of time. But I can get all the possibilities if you wanted.
