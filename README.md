Train myself about code skills from Codeforces just problemA.
And if you have got the better method to solve the problems, please let me know.

Tips:
*.pdf is the description about the problem to be solve. Also you can access on the web http://codeforces.com/problemset according to the numbers of the problem.

*.cpp is the method that I solve the problem using GNU C++ 4.7 compiler, and all the code are accepted by Codeforces.

*.txt is the note about optimize and error I made when I try to figure it out.

logfile is the personal note about how to figure it out.
